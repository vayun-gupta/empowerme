# EmpowerMe

EmpowerMe is a prototype web product designed to help users practice and navigate high-stakes professional conversations.

Instead of focusing on confidence or motivation, the product provides structured role-play scenarios and reflective coaching that help users anticipate resistance, respond strategically, and build predictability in leadership interactions.

## Problem
Many capable users experience uncertainty and hesitation in leadership settings due to unpredictable responses, hidden rules, and institutional resistance. Existing tools focus on personal confidence rather than situational skill building.

## Approach
The prototype uses a dual-agent interaction model:
- An adversary role that simulates realistic resistance patterns
- A coach role that provides structured feedback and reflection

Interactions are inspired by card-based frameworks used in leadership training workshops.

## Status
This repository contains research notes, design rationale, and prototype artifacts created as part of an academic AI product design course.

## Disclaimer
This is a conceptual prototype and not a deployed system.
